## Implementaion
- The theory, code and dataset used is from the references
- The experiments was ran over different combinations of the datasets, attention and features

## Challanges
- Since the code was running on CPU only, many experiments failed due to termination
- It took a lot of time to train and test the models

## Documentation
- The submission has visualization and results of the successful experiments
- Some result comparisions and visualizations are incomplete due to the mentioned challanges
